## Introduction

This project focuses on portfolio optimization, a crucial aspect of financial management aimed at maximizing returns and minimizing risk. By leveraging various optimization techniques, we aim to construct an optimal portfolio of assets.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to Portfolio Optimization**:
   - Explanation of the objectives and importance of portfolio optimization.

2. **Data Import and Preparation**:
   - Importing necessary libraries.
   - Loading and cleaning financial data for the assets.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Descriptive statistics and visualization of asset prices and returns.

4. **Portfolio Optimization Methods**:
   - Implementing Mean-Variance Optimization.
   - Risk Parity Optimization.
   - Visualizing the Efficient Frontier.

5. **Results and Analysis**:
   - Optimal portfolio weights.
   - Comparison of different optimization methods.
   - Visualization of results.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Summary of findings.
   - Future work and potential improvements.
